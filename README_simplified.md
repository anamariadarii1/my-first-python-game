# Jetpack Pug Platformer

## Project Description
Jetpack Pug Platformer is an engaging platformer game developed using Pygame. In this game, the player controls a pug equipped with a jetpack to navigate through various platforms, collect coins, and avoid obstacles. The game aims to achieve the highest score by collecting as many coins as possible while maintaining balance and avoiding falling.

### Algorithms Used
The game incorporates several algorithms and techniques to enhance gameplay:

1. **Physics Engine**: The game uses basic physics principles to simulate gravity, acceleration, and friction. This is achieved using Pygame's `Vector2` class to handle the pug's movement.
2. **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions between the pug and platforms using Pygame's `spritecollide` function to ensure smooth landing and jumping mechanics.
3. **Platform Generation**: Platforms are generated randomly to create an unpredictable and challenging environment for the player.
